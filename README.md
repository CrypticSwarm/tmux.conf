Tmux Configuration
==================

This tmux configuation tries to aim to have as little impact on terminal programs as possible. That means no C-a or C-b bindings (both are very useful in VIM).  My default prefix is M-a.  Which end up being alt/options key.  I remap that to the caps lock key.

## install

```shell
cd [the tmux config repo]
./install.sh
```

## Mac

On mac you probably want to intall reattach to user namespace.
